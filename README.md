# 1. Overview
The wide spectrum of data sources, data collection methods and predictive models makes accurate data-driven prediction a challenging task. It is particularly difficult for road traffic analysts performing traffic forecasting due to the following main reasons:  
(i) the high complexity of Traffic Predictive Analytics (TPA); (ii) the in-existence of a single predictive model that works well in any TPA scenario; and (iii) the fact that traffic analysts often do not possess all required skills for performing data-driven traffic forecasting, which typically range from traffic theory to data science. The combination of these reasons raises difficult questions about which predictive model is most suitable for a given TPA problem. To facilitate the job of traffic analysts, we propose TAG-F, a traffic predictive analytics guidance framework. It provides a structured collection of analytical decision points that can serve as a roadmap to enable the traffic analyst to traverse from the traffic problem space to an analytical solution space, culminating in an action, typically prediction. TAG-F can also serve as a decision support mechanism for traffic analysts by providing guidance in the choice of a predictive model, given the TPA specifics. We demonstrate the practicality of the framework via a comprehensive evaluation, using a number of urban traffic prediction cases of varying complexity, based on real-world data collected from the arterial roads of Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom.

Current traffic management and control practices are dominated by the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), resulting from technological advancement, data ubiquity, and the abundance of statistical and machine learning-based traffic prediction models. This is realized by the application of predictive analytics, mainly using historical traffic data collected from one or more traffic data sensors. However, achieving accurate data-driven traffic parameter prediction is difficult for three key reasons.

1. Traffic management is a complex problem. For example, the management of a single traffic parameter, such as traffic flow, involves knowledge of complex interactions between individual agents (e.g., road users, traffic analysts) and infrastructure (e.g., traffic controls, roads, etc.), affected by dynamically-changing traffic variables (e.g., traffic density, occupancy and intensity) and exogenous factors, such as calendar (e.g., time of day, day of week, etc.), weather (e.g., rainfall, temperature, etc.), events, road works, and accidents. For this reason, the application of predictive analytics in support of traffic management (a.k.a., Traffic Predictive Analytics or TPA) is a very convoluted field.
2. There is a plethora of predictive algorithms/models in use today, reflecting the highly interdisciplinary nature of the subject, with contributions from the fields of Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Operations Management, to name a few. As each of these algorithms can be applied towards data-driven traffic prediction, despite showing different accuracy levels in their results, it is difficult for a traffic data analyst to know which algorithm to apply, as most traffic data analysts do not possess knowledge about each and every one of these PAMs.
3. According to the [No Free Lunch (NFL) principle](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel1/4235/12703/00585893.pdf?casa_token=cuhy6pTHYWUAAAAA:8duet9M54hv6J0EElxrE81Vv0uT4apYFUIq8cnCEqYBOMIFSOZIhRsKsIUe20enaMxOy7WXY) , no single PAM that has been shown to be the best performing algorithm in one situation, can be shown to be the best performing algorithm in all predictive situations. Therefore, it is often the case that a PAM that performs very well in a given condition or scenario is likely perform poorly in other scenarios. As traffic prediction takes different forms based on the problem definition, it is a challenge to know which PAM is suitable to be adopted in the solution to a given predictive analytics problem. 

Based on the reasons given above, there is a need to provide guidance to traffic data analysts in carrying out TPA. While there are existing traffic systems that provide guidance to road users in the form of route guidance and traffic state information using Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS), e.g., Google Maps, Waze, and Garmin, etc., to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no system able to provide guidance to analysts towards performing TPA. This is what TAG-F aims to provide. TAG-F delineates data-driven traffic prediction as a set of three dimensions, thereby providing a structured collection of analytical decision points that can serve as a roadmap to enable the traffic data scientist traverse from the traffic problem space to the analytical solution space, culminating in an action/outcome, usually prediction. TAG-F can also serve as a decision support mechanism for traffic data scientists by providing guidance in the choice of a predictive model, given the traffic data context specifications. 

# 2. Traffic Predictive Analytics (TPA) Guidance Framework
![alt text](https://github.com/nakessien/tagf_evaluation/blob/master/Picture1.png?raw=true)
The figure above shows a conceptual model of the guidance offered by TAG-F. The overall aim is to guide or assist the traffic data analyst to traverse (i.e. navigate) from a state in which the solution path is unknown/unclear to a point where this path (i.e. towards achieving the solution) is clearly defined. In the figure, this is represented using the bold arrow at the bottom, indicating a traversal from the bottom left to the bottom right. 

The left-hand side of the figure (and the key issues) represents the inputs to the TPA guidance process. The problem specification refers to the specific TPA problem, which is articulated via user requirements gathering, directives from government or regulatory bodies, etc. The domain knowledge refers to the knowledge base developed from what is available from the literature using a [literature-based discovery process](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/asi.21236?casa_token=9uXAj6Ul3KEAAAAA:4fiG2zEXeNVuY3ed7gSeAUeJca3tOI6hGFRLZAn3HGDeG4L8Jd94-KekD9T_53VEtM2h_bydO8lphA). Finally, the degree of guidance refers to one of the three levels of guidance – prescriptive, directional, and orientation. 

The guidance (middle partition of the figure) is generated by providing an answer to the question ‘what does the user need to know in order to make progress?’ and is achieved by providing solutions to the key issues that arise from the understanding of each respective TPA dimension (three circles). The guidance provided by the conceptual framework relates to the degree of decision support provided to a (user) traffic data analyst in order to arrive at a desired output (i.e. prediction). Our guidance framework offers two-fold output: first, a structure for systematically defining the TPA problem and, second, the suggestion of suitable predictive algorithm for a specific prediction problem.

# 3. Framework Evaluation - real-world case scenarios
A prototype tool was developed to evaluate the guidance provided by TAG-F, which enables semi-automated directional guidance to traffic data scientists by suggesting alternative PAMs to given TPA problem scenarios. The TAG-F support tool, which complements the framework, takes as input a set of TAG-F dimension values (provided by the user) and returns a ranked list of suggestions in terms of alternative predictive models from a portfolio of seven (7) candidate models - ARIMA, Kalman Filter, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, LSTM, k-Nearest Neighbour, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).

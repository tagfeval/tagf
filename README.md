 Synopsis
 ==========
 
 Traffic Predictive Analytics Guidance Framework (TAG-F) is a guidance framework that aims at bridging this gap. The framework delineates data-driven traffic prediction as a set of three dimensions, thereby providing a structured collection of analytical decision points that can serve as a roadmap to enable the traffic data scientist traverse from the traffic problem space to the analytical solution space, culminating in an action/outcome, usually prediction. TAG-F – via the tool – can also be used to provide decision support for traffic data scientists by providing guidance in the choice of predictive analytical method (PAM), given the data context specifications. The framework and tool were evaluated using real-world traffic prediction scenarios in an urban arterial in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom.

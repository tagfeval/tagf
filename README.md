Evaluation of Traffic Predictive Analytics Guidance Framework (TAG-F). Please see {} for thesis.

TAG-F delineates data-driven traffic prediction as a set of three dimensions, thereby providing a structured collection of analytical decision points that can serve as a roadmap to enable the traffic data scientist traverse from the traffic problem space to the analytical solution space, culminating in an action/outcome, usually prediction. TAG-F can also serve as a decision support mechanism for traffic data scientists by providing guidance in the choice of a predictive model, given the traffic data context specifications.

# 1. Overview
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have revolutionized how businesses and societies operate, enabling the business models of companies such as Uber, DiDi, Geotab, and Siemens Mobility. An ITS refers to "a system of technologies and operational advancements that, when combined and managed, improve the capabilities of the overall transportation system" (Sharon Chan-Edmiston, Stephanie Fischer, Suzanne Sloan, Melissa Wong 2020, p.7). A critical success factor for ITS world-wide is providing accurate and reliable information to road users, businesses, and traffic authorities. This is achieved by applying predictive analytics using historical traffic data collected from sensors in devices owned by transportation stakeholders (e.g., mobile phone GPS sensors) or deployed in the traffic network infrastructure (e.g., inductive loops). Predictive analytics "include statistical models and other empirical methods that are aimed at creating empirical predictions" (Shmueli and Koppius 2011, p.554). The goal of predictive analytics is "forecasting, modeling, and understanding the future behavior of a system based on historical and/or real-time data" (Lamba et al. 2021,
chap. 1, p. 2). Predictive analytics applied to traffic management and control can improve traffic outcomes, such as congestion, pollution, and noise (Lana et al. 2018, Ermagun and Levinson 2018).

Yet, data-driven traffic prediction is associated with significant challenges:

1. Complexity: Traffic management is a "wicked problem" (Rittel and Webber 1973); one where both the solution and the means (of achieving it) are ambiguous or undetermined. For example, managing a single traffic parameter, such as traffic flow, involves knowledge of complex interactions between individual agents (e.g., road users) and infrastructure (e.g., traffic controls, roads, etc.) affected by dynamically changing traffic variables (e.g., traffic density, occupancy, and intensity) and exogenous factors, such as calendar (e.g., time of day, day of week, etc.), weather (e.g., rainfall, temperature, etc.), events (e.g., sporting games, musical concerts, etc.), road works, and accidents.
2. Choice & Uncertainty: There is a plethora of Predictive Analytical Methods/models (PAM) in use, reflecting the highly interdisciplinary nature of the subject. The choice of which PAM to adopt in a given TPA scenario is subjected to uncertainty (Vlahogianni et al. 2014) arising from incomplete data, noise, inaccurate data due to errors in measurement from road sensors, modeling assumptions, and unknown factors affecting the outcome. It is common for traffic data analysts to choose a PAM without understanding the technical and analytical characteristics of the algorithms and traffic domain task fitness. Research on the use of PAMs in the traffic domain is still in its early stages. There is a lack of meta-knowledge about the advantages and disadvantages of different PAMs, and about which PAMs are appropriate for particular problem scenarios. Several studies serve as evidence (e.g., Vlahogianni et al. (2014), Lana et al. (2018), Ermagun and Levinson (2018), Dahal et al. (2013)) on how quickly PAMs are superseded due to the rapidly evolving research area of short-term traffic prediction.
3. No free lunch (NFL) principle: according to the NFL principle (Wolpert and Macready 1997), there is no single PAM proven to be the best performing in every situation, as demonstrated in Wolpert (2021) and other studies (Adam et al. 2019, Brazdil et al. 2003, Serafino 2021, Moniz and Monteiro 2021, Lumini et al. 2022). Therefore, a PAM achieving high accuracy for a particular task/problem might perform poorly when applied to a different problem. This underscores the need for decision support towards choosing a PAM for a TPA problem.

Predictive Analytics skills/knowledge gaps: Several key stakeholders are involved in the design, operation, and management of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Traffic data analysts collect, clean, and analyze data by applying PAMs to identify patterns and propose solutions to improve traffic flow. Traffic analysts are typically involved in traffic system planning and engineering processes and are directly responsible for traffic network control and management (Taylor and Bonsall 2017). A typical example involves traffic analysts and operatives, for instance in traffic control centers (TCC). In congested situations, traffic analysts can manually, automatically, or semi-
automatically alter the traffic parameters, such as traffic light signals, lane closure/opening, and speed limit alteration. The traffic analyst’s role, therefore, requires expertise in the traffic domain. This role differs from the traffic data analyst, who is often a data science and predictive analytics expert. Industry reports indicate that the value creation from transport data exploration involves: "Predictive and real-time analytics, and automated control systems, that optimize capacity about
demand across all transport networks" (Catapult 2015, p.8), and the importance of "skilled technical talent capable of handling and analyzing very large datasets compiled from multiple sources" (Catapult 2015, p.9). In our work and collaboration with traffic management stakeholders, we have observed a wider prevalence of traffic analysts’ staff roles/skills, scarcity of traffic data analyst staff roles/skills, and limited adoption of the latest PAMs in the research literature, with immense potential for decisional guidance and decision support features in finding suitable PAMs

Based on the reasons given above, there is a need to provide guidance to traffic data analysts in carrying out TPA. While there are existing traffic systems that provide guidance to road users in the form of route guidance and traffic state information using Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS), e.g., Google Maps, Waze, and Garmin, etc., to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no system able to provide guidance to analysts towards performing TPA. This is what TAG-F aims to provide. TAG-F delineates data-driven traffic prediction as a set of three dimensions, thereby providing a structured collection of analytical decision points that can serve as a roadmap to enable the traffic data scientist traverse from the traffic problem space to the analytical solution space, culminating in an action/outcome, usually prediction. TAG-F can also serve as a decision support mechanism for traffic data scientists by providing guidance in the choice of a predictive model, given the traffic data context specifications. 

# 2. Traffic Predictive Analytics (TPA) Guidance Framework
![alt text](https://github.com/tagfeval/tagf/blob/master/Picture1.png)
The figure above shows a conceptual model of the guidance offered by TAG-F. The overall aim is to guide or assist the traffic data analyst to traverse (i.e. navigate) from a state in which the solution path is unknown/unclear to a point where this path (i.e. towards achieving the solution) is clearly defined. In the figure, this is represented using the bold arrow at the bottom, indicating a traversal from the bottom left to the bottom right. 

The left-hand side of the figure (and the key issues) represents the inputs to the TPA guidance process. The problem specification refers to the specific TPA problem, which is articulated via user requirements gathering, directives from government or regulatory bodies, etc. The domain knowledge refers to the knowledge base developed from what is available from the literature using a [literature-based discovery process](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/asi.21236?casa_token=9uXAj6Ul3KEAAAAA:4fiG2zEXeNVuY3ed7gSeAUeJca3tOI6hGFRLZAn3HGDeG4L8Jd94-KekD9T_53VEtM2h_bydO8lphA). Finally, the degree of guidance refers to one of the three levels of guidance – prescriptive, directional, and orientation. 

The guidance (middle partition of the figure) is generated by providing an answer to the question ‘what does the user need to know in order to make progress?’ and is achieved by providing solutions to the key issues that arise from the understanding of each respective TPA dimension (three circles). The guidance provided by the conceptual framework relates to the degree of decision support provided to a (user) traffic data analyst in order to arrive at a desired output (i.e. prediction). Our guidance framework offers two-fold output: first, a structure for systematically defining the TPA problem and, second, the suggestion of suitable predictive algorithm for a specific prediction problem.

# 3. Framework Evaluation - real-world case scenarios
A prototype tool was developed to evaluate the guidance provided by TAG-F, which enables semi-automated directional guidance to traffic data scientists by suggesting alternative PAMs to given TPA problem scenarios. The TAG-F support tool, which complements the framework, takes as input a set of TAG-F dimension values (provided by the user) and returns a ranked list of suggestions in terms of alternative predictive models from a portfolio of seven (7) candidate models - ARIMA, Kalman Filter, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, LSTM, k-Nearest Neighbour, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).
